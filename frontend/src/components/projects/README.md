# Project-Specific Components

Reusable sections that enhance individual project pages live here. Components are mapped to project
slugs via `index.ts` so `ProjectLayout` can render them automatically after the Markdown content.
This keeps WASM demos and rich visuals alongside the new Astro layout while legacy pages remain
available for reference.
