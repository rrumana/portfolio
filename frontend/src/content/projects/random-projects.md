## What lives here
Not every idea graduates into a full project page. Some are Advent of Code marathons, others are homelab experiments, editor tweaks, or quick utilities built to solve a one-off problem. This bucket collects the repos I iterate on when curiosity strikes.

## Highlights
- Seasonal Advent of Code solutions, mostly in Rust, with benchmarks for alternative approaches.
- Hyprland + Arch dotfiles, shell scripts, and observability glue that make my daily workstation hum.
- Proto-homelab services and Neovim experiments that may grow into standalone write-ups later.

## Follow along
My GitHub profile is the best place to see what's brewing. I try to document the interesting bits and ship code that others can fork, run, and riff on. The latest Advent of Code sprint lives in [this repository](https://github.com/rrumana/Advent_Of_Code_2024) if you're curious about the solutions.
