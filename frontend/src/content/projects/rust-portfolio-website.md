## Why Rust + Astro
The site started as a static HTML project and matured into a Rust-first stack so I could bring
backend reliability, strong typing, and WebAssembly experiments into the same codebase. Astro powers
the new front end while Axum handles APIs, auth experiments, and homelab integrations.

## Platform highlights
- Shared content collections let the backend, Astro pages, and WASM apps reuse the same data model.
- Docker images bundle the backend binary with pre-rendered Astro assets for fast, repeatable
  deployments into my k3s cluster.
- CI scripts run `cargo fmt`, Clippy, and frontend builds to keep quality gates consistent across
  language boundaries.

## Roadmap
Dark mode, richer project pages, and automated WASM rebuilds are in flight. The goal is a portfolio
that feels as maintainable as a production serviceâ€”with observability, integration tests, and clean
content workflows.
