## Overview
Reverse Game of Life turns Conway's classic cellular automaton on its head. Instead of only simulating
future states, the project asks a harder question: *what grid could have produced this pattern?* The
solution encodes the game rules as a SAT problem, leans on Rust for performance, and ships a WASM
front end so visitors can experiment in the browser.

## Highlights
- Encodes cell transitions as boolean constraints and solves them via SAT to backtrack prior states.
- Ships a WASM-powered playground where you can draw patterns, step forward or backward, and export
  GIFs of the evolution.
- Includes Rust crates for simulation, constraint building, and wasm-bindgen bindings to keep the
  codebase modular and testable.

## Lessons learned
Modeling the automaton as SAT exposed performance trade-offs quickly: na√Øve encodings ballooned in
size, so I leaned on Rust's iterators and memory ownership to keep generation tight. The WASM layer
proved invaluable for debugging, because every change could be visualized immediately.
