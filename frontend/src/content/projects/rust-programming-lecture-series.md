## Course at a glance
The lecture walks polyglot engineers through Rust's mental model fast: starting with ownership,
borrowing, and lifetimes before layering on async, tooling, and patterns for safe systems
programming. I built it as a 3-hour live session for postgraduate students and industry teams who
needed a practical, opinionated introduction.

## Format and tooling
- Live-coding exercises anchored in Cargo workspaces and unit tests so attendees see feedback loops in
  action.
- Slides contrast Rust idioms with C++/Python equivalents, making it easier to spot when to lean on
  enums, pattern matching, or zero-cost abstractions.
- Demos showcase how the borrow checker enforces invariants and how to reach for `async`/`await`
  without fighting the compiler.

## In the works
I'm capturing the lecture as a recorded series with companion labs. The repo already hosts the slide
deck, code samples, and facilitator notes; the video release is next so folks can self-pace the
content.
