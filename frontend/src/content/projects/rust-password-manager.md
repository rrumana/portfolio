## Project goals
I wanted to explore what it would take to build a trustworthy password manager from the ground up.
That meant leaning on Rust's safety guarantees while following the guidance from NIST SP 800-63 for
credential storage, MFA flows, and recovery paths.

## Architecture sketch
- Axum API layers enforce rate limits, session handling, and structured auditing.
- Credentials are wrapped in envelope encryption, using Argon2id for key derivation and per-record
  nonces for defense in depth.
- PostgreSQL stores encrypted blobs alongside metadata so revocation, rotation, and device sync stay
  manageable.

## Current status
The project is still in motion: I'm integrating WebAuthn support and threat-modeling the recovery
voice. Even unfinished, the repo documents the cryptographic decisions and lays the groundwork for a
fully self-hosted deployment.

## Inspiration
This effort draws heavily from the [Bitwarden security whitepaper](https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-security-white-paper/),
which outlines threat models, encryption design, and operational processes for a mature credential
platform.
