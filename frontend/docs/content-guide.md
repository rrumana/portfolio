# Content Collections

Astro content collections live in `src/content/`. Each subdirectory represents a collection (for
example, `projects/`). Markdown/MDX entries inside those folders provide structured frontmatter that
components consume. Keep reference notes like this outside the collection tree so Astro's parser only
sees valid entries.
