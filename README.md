My personal portfolio website

Built in Rust because why not? I have literally no need for such a comprehensive framework, but oh well.

Currently, it is just a template with no real content, no error handling, no tests, or anything like that.

I imagine it will get a lot better as I come to understand Axum, HTML, and CSS better

I have also containerized this project so that I can integrate it into my current docker stack.

This is mostly for fun and to show off my cool projects.
