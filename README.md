My personal portfolio website

This website is going to be a long running project. 

Currently, it is just a template with no real content, no error handling, no tests, or anything like that.

I imagine it will get a lot better as I come to understand Axum, HTML, and CSS better

This is mostly for fun and to show off my cool projects.
