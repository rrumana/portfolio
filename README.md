Built in Rust because why not? 

Built using Axum framework just to lern a little bit about Rust web development. I have literally no need for such a comprehensive framework, but oh well.

Currently, it is just a template with no real content, no error handling, no tests, or anything like that. It will probably stay that way since I am simply serving static HTML and CSS right now.

I have also containerized this project so that I can integrate it into my current docker stack. The dockerfile and docker compose file that I use are included as well.

This is mostly for fun and to show off my cool projects. I will probably add a blog at some point, but I am not sure when that will be.
