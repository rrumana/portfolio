### Core Components

#### 1. **Web Backend** ([`backend/`](backend/))
- **Framework**: [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) for high-performance async web serving
- **Features**: 
  - Static file serving with custom middleware
  - RESTful API endpoints for Game of Life simulation
  - Request logging and error handling
  - Sitemap generation

#### 2. **WebAssembly Engine** ([`wasm_game_of_life/`](wasm_game_of_life/))
- **Purpose**: Browser-based Game of Life simulation with near-native performance
- **Features**:
  - SIMD-optimized cellular automaton engine compiled to WASM
  - Interactive grid manipulation and pattern loading
  - Text-to-pattern conversion using ASCII art
  - Real-time simulation with configurable speed
- **Build Target**: `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/)

#### 3. **Game of Life Engine** ([`game_of_life/`](../game_of_life/))
- **Multiple Engine Implementations**:
  - **Naive Engine**: Basic implementation for reference
  - **SIMD Engine**: Vectorized operations using portable SIMD
  - **Ultimate Engine**: Highly optimized with multiple boundary conditions
- **Features**:
  - Support for dead, wrap, and mirror boundary conditions
  - Comprehensive benchmarking suite
  - Pattern I/O with multiple formats
  - Grid resizing and state management

#### 4. **Reverse Game of Life Solver** ([`game_of_life_reverse/`](../game_of_life_reverse/))
- **Problem**: NP-Complete reverse cellular automaton solving
- **Approach**: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem reduction
- **SAT Solvers**: 
  - [CaDiCaL](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical) for single-threaded solving
  - [ParKissat-RS](https://github.com/shaowei-cai-group/ParKissat-RS) for parallel solving
- **Features**:
  - Multi-generation predecessor finding
  - Solution validation and analysis
  - Configurable optimization levels
  - Pattern recognition and quality analysis

#### 5. **Custom SAT Solver Bindings** ([`parkissat-sys/`](../parkissat-sys/))
- **Purpose**: Safe Rust bindings for ParKissat-RS SAT solver
- **Implementation**: FFI bindings with [`bindgen`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/) and [`cc`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs)
- **Features**: Memory-safe wrapper around C++ SAT solver

#### 6. **Text Processing Utilities** ([`text_to_input/`](../text_to_input/))
- **Purpose**: Convert text strings to Game of Life patterns
- **Implementation**: It's a Hashmap...
- **Integration**: Used by both WASM frontend and reverse solver

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Features

### Performance Optimizations

- **SIMD Vectorization**: Portable SIMD for cross-platform performance
- **Memory Layout**: Cache-friendly data structures for cellular automaton simulation
- **WebAssembly**: Near-native performance in browsers
- **Parallel SAT Solving**: Multi-threaded constraint satisfaction
- **Link-Time Optimization**: Aggressive compiler optimizations for release builds

## üöÄ Deployment

### Docker Containerization

The project uses a multi-stage Docker build:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Rust compilation with multiple targets
FROM rust:latest AS builder
RUN rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Stage 2: Minimal Alpine runtime
FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk add --no-cache ca-certificates
```

**Features**:
- Multi-target compilation (native + WASM)
- Static linking for minimal runtime dependencies
- Optimized binary size with `musl` target
- Automatic dependency cloning from GitHub

### Self-Hosted Infrastructure
